## Chronological updates

- 2026-09-21: Baseline on the shared base recorded in the refactor task's Step 0 report; vLLM reference cloned (no tags in the fork; upstream `v0.10.2` comparison deferred to Step 1).
- 2026-09-21: Draft specification analyzed; eleven facts verified against main, the candidate, the submodule remote, and the host; planning interview settled twelve decisions (see `requirements.md`). Records landed under `task_memory/`, `.gitignore` narrowed, `plan.md` carries the Amendments table.
- 2026-09-21: Step 1 audit complete. Three pinned-source audits landed as `audit_scheduler.md`, `audit_predictor_profiling.md`, `reference_vllm_0_10_2.md`; dispositions and two decision checkpoints recorded in `review.md`. Execution order corrected to W2 first, then W3, then W4, because the candidate's report-order key depends on the shared forward identity. The vLLM fork was confirmed to be a direct descendant of upstream v0.10.2 with the DP placement files byte-identical to the tag.
